Why might that be interesting? I overview the performance, accessibility, SEO, and security implications this site (and yours?) could have compared to a competitive site generated by Jekyll. I also show, with provable evidence, how this tech stack supersedes some of Jekyll's aspects.<h1 id=jekyll>Jekyll?</h1><p><a href=https://jekyllrb.com/ rel=noopener target=_blank>Jekyll</a> was written in Ruby and is the most popular static site generator (SSG) in use. The SSG ingests <a href=https://markdown-it.github.io/ rel=noopener target=_blank>Markdown</a> formatted text and uses templates to generate a static website. Jekyll seems ideal for those quickly publishing thoughts with nice formatting. <a href=https://pages.github.com/ rel=noopener target=_blank>GitHub Pages</a> is <em>powered</em> by Jekyll<sup class=footnote-reference><a href=#ghpages_poweredby>1</a></sup>, and GitHub will use Jekyll to build a site by default<sup class=footnote-reference><a href=#github_rec>2</a></sup>. These reasons and special privileges make Jekyll a <del>safe</del> popular option for most users.<p>The general workflow is to 1) install Jekyll, 2) create a project, and 3) host it on GitHub. If you create a GitHub repository named <code>&LTusername>.github.io</code>, GitHub will automagically host this with GitHub Pages for free<sup class=footnote-reference><a href=#ghpages_quickstart>3</a></sup>. You <strong>can</strong> use alternative static site generators with GitHub Pages' hosting, which we will explore later.<h1 id=technologies>Technologies</h1><p>It's time to introduce the components that get taped together to present what you see now and de-obfuscate the magic. I install <a href=https://www.getzola.org/ rel=noopener target=_blank>Zola</a> as a Rust-alternative SSG to Jekyll. Contrary to Jekyll, Zola makes <em>minimal</em> robust assumptions about content. Moreover, Zola needs a "<em>theme</em>" to dictate the output of static sites, providing valuable flexibility for developers wanting more control. I chose <em>Jieiku</em>'s "<a href=https://github.com/Jieiku/abridge rel=noopener target=_blank>Abridge</a>" theme with Zola for its maturity as a blogging theme. I later explain how I host, test, and deploy my blog for free using <a href=https://pages.github.com/ rel=noopener target=_blank>GitHub Pages</a> and <a href=https://github.com/features/actions rel=noopener target=_blank>GitHub Actions</a>.<table><thead><tr><th>Name<th>Purpose<tbody><tr><td><a href=https://www.getzola.org/ rel=noopener target=_blank>Zola</a><td>SSG written in Rust<tr><td><a href=https://github.com/Jieiku/abridge rel=noopener target=_blank>Abridge</a><td>Zola theme (No JS)<tr><td><a href=https://pages.github.com/ rel=noopener target=_blank>GitHub Pages</a><td>Free hosting for static sites<tr><td><a href=https://github.com/features/actions rel=noopener target=_blank>GitHub Actions</a>*<td>CI/CD for Zola</table><p>* Optional<h1 id=zola-s-opportunities>Zola's opportunities</h1><p>Why do I favor Zola over Jekyll? Let's clear the air on Zola - <strong>It's not because of WASM</strong>. Rust's famous ability to transpile into Web Assembly (WASM) may be hip and trendy, but this is not the reason Zola is substituting Jekyll. Zola is a mature SSG with all of the necessities. The SSG offers live-reload previewing, scalability, markdown, and more. But most importantly, Zola makes fewer assumptions about content, allowing a static website exactly how I want it.<h2 id=operability>Operability</h2><p>One contentious point with Jekyll was operability. As a Rust developer, I enjoy the ability to fix issues if they arise. Since Jekyll is written in Ruby, this presented a language barrier to me, or any rustacean, who otherwise has no interest in Ruby. From the perspective exclusive to a blogger, one should never need to write Ruby, only markdown. My conflict was with the undertone of uncertainty I had relying on Jekyll as a backend. Generally speaking, I <em>wanted</em> the ability to fix or contribute to my backend SSG, Zola.<h2 id=lighthouse-metrics>Lighthouse metrics</h2><p>Jekyll potentially makes all the right tradeoffs as a simple, blog-aware solution. Unfortunately, inherent to those compromises, one can expect to record off-nominal results from web-scoring frameworks. <a href=https://web.dev/measure/ rel=noopener target=_blank>Google Lighthouse</a> is one such analytic framework that provides meaningful analysis for web scoring. When measuring several blogs with Jekyll, Lighthouse suggests opportunities for improvement across several axes of measurement. I will pick on <a href=https://raphlinus.github.io rel=noopener target=_blank>Raph Levien's blog</a> for evidence. He is a friend and active publisher in the Rust community, well known for his work on <a href=https://xi-editor.io/ rel=noopener target=_blank>Xi</a>, <a href=https://github.com/linebender/druid rel=noopener target=_blank>Druid</a>, and <a href=https://github.com/linebender/piet rel=noopener target=_blank>Piet</a>. Measuring his Jekyll blog is a good example, as several points are missing from a perfect score. Because Zola is very flexible, my objective was to abuse the finer control given to receive a perfect score.<div align=center><img alt="Raph's Lighthouse metrics" src=raph_seo.png></div><p><em><a href=raphlinus.github.io_2022-05-15_10-46-19.html>Click here for Raph's Lighthouse report</a></em><h2 id=security>Security</h2><p>Indeed, a blog will typically only contain first-party-origin scripts and original content, so security is not a typical, or even legitimate, concern. However, I would like to endorse <em>some</em> benefits over Jekyll. Since Lighthouse does not measure security, I chose the <a href=https://observatory.mozilla.org/ rel=noopener target=_blank>Mozilla Observatory</a> as a supplemental analytic framework to analyze. In using the Observatory, I found that Jekyll didn't aspire to mitigate some benign security concerns.<p>Generally, web security guarantees are from the web server, not the blog. These guarantees come as headers, certificates (SSL), and more. Aware, the developers of Jekyll delegate this grandiose responsibility to you. This task seems like an impossible problem if you do not control the web servers (e.g. GitHub Pages).<p>As a GitHub Pages user, I encountered this plight. However, there are a number of headers that can be enforced inline. These headers can be in-lined with control over the site templating, e.g. Zola.<h1 id=abridge>Abridge</h1><p>Zola has an <a href=https://www.getzola.org/themes/ rel=noopener target=_blank>index of themes</a> for generating varying static sites, such as documentation sites, blogs, or portfolios. In a journey to find the most mature blogging theme, I began with <a href=https://www.getzola.org/themes/adidoks/ rel=noopener target=_blank>Adidoks</a>. As time went on, I had to replace it<sup class=footnote-reference><a href=#del_adidoks>4</a></sup>, citing poor support for tagging, pagination, RSS/Atom, and more.<p>Enter Abridge. Abridge is a semantic classlight theme designed to be a modern emulation of Jekyll; fast, light, perfect. With caution in avoiding similar mistakes, I did my research. Abridge has support for these taxonomies, and most importantly, no javascript (<a href=https://jieiku.github.io/abridge-demo/ rel=noopener target=_blank>demo</a>).<h2 id=improvements-over-jekyll>Improvements over Jekyll</h2><p>Abridge had some issues at first. For weeks I contributed to the source, making it accessible to a wider audience, and addressing the shortcomings of Jekyll. <a href="https://github.com/Jieiku/abridge/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed" rel=noopener target=_blank>Some of my contributions</a> include asynchronous deferral of font loading to improve the first contentful paint, fontawesome support, more social icons, SEO optimizations, color skins, and config options. Now I am happy to say Abridge <em>feels</em> like the most mature, minimal theme for blogging.<p>Abridge is, in my opinion, ready for adoption. Specifically, this theme is engineered as a better Jekyll with improved performance, accessibility, SEO, and security. If Abridge does get a perfect scorecard on Google Lighthouse, it is a bug. <a href=https://github.com/Jieiku/abridge/issues/new rel=noopener target=_blank>Please file an issue</a>.<div align=center><img alt="Abridge's Lighthouse score" src=abridge_seo.png></div><table><thead><tr><th>Audit<th>Jekyll<th>Abridge<th>Gain<tbody><tr><td>Performance<td>95<td>100<td>5.00%<tr><td>Accessibility<td>97<td>100<td>3.00%<tr><td>Best Practices<td>100<td>100<td>Same<tr><td>SEO<td>99<td>100<td>1.00%</table><p>As previously suggested, security is a bit of a red herring, and I hold the opinion that the Mozilla Observatory is poorly calibrated. However, I show that security was improved regardless, especially for users without administrative privilege over their web server. While Jekyll scores an <strong>F</strong>, Abridge scores a <strong>B-</strong>, subject to improve further.<table><tr><th>Jekyll's Security<th>Abridge's Security<tr><td><div align=center><img alt="Raph's Observatory metrics" src=raph_security.png></div><td><div align=center><img alt="My Observatory score" src=my_security.png></div></table><table><thead><tr><th>Audit<th>Jekyll<th>Abridge<th>Gain<tbody><tr><td>Grade<td>F<td>B-<td>N/A<tr><td>Score<td>20/100<td>65/100<td>45.00%<tr><td>Tests Passed<td>6/11<td>8/11<td>18.18%</table><h1 id=deployment>Deployment</h1><p>Deployment with Zola and Abridge came with a few hiccups, but nothing too major.<h2 id=github-pages>GitHub Pages</h2><p>I chose GitHub Pages for hosting because of its convenience with GitHub. If one creates a GitHub repository named <code>&LTusername>.github.io</code> or converts a repository to a Pages deployment, GitHub will graciously host static content for free and treat the code contained as the source code for Jekyll. <em>More on creating a GitHub Pages site <a href=https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site rel=noopener target=_blank>here</a></em>.<p>There were two main pitfalls I was a victim to.<ul><li>GitHub Pages requires some ceremony to opt out of Jekyll. GitHub requires a <a href=https://github.com/simbleau/simbleau.github.io/blob/main/.nojekyll rel=noopener target=_blank><code>.nojekyll</code></a> file in the root level of the repository since GitHub defaults you into using Jekyll<sup class=footnote-reference><a href=#github_rec>2</a></sup>.<li>I have a custom domain name, and with that, I needed to stage a <a href=https://github.com/simbleau/simbleau.github.io/blob/main/zola/static/CNAME rel=noopener target=_blank><code>CNAME</code></a> file in the <a href=https://github.com/simbleau/simbleau.github.io/tree/main/zola/static rel=noopener target=_blank><code>static/</code></a> directory of my Zola repository.</ul><p><em>If you're considering a migration to GitHub Pages, the Zola guide is <a href=https://www.getzola.org/documentation/deployment/github-pages/ rel=noopener target=_blank>here</a></em>.<h2 id=github-actions>GitHub Actions</h2><p>My favorite aspect of this tech stack is the autonomy. GitHub Actions is a powerful, free CI/CD which cooperates with Zola. Pushing a commit can trigger a build or deployment. Thankfully, the authors of Zola provide an easy GitHub Action, batteries included.<p>You can see <a href=https://github.com/simbleau/simbleau.github.io/blob/main/.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml rel=noopener target=_blank>my actual workflow</a>, but here is a minimal example:<pre class="language-yaml z-code" data-lang=yaml><code class=language-yaml data-lang=yaml><span class="z-source z-yaml"><span class="z-constant z-language z-boolean z-yaml">on</span><span class="z-punctuation z-separator z-key-value z-mapping z-yaml">:</span> <span class="z-string z-unquoted z-plain z-out z-yaml">push</span>

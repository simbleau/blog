# My philosophy
Education should be completely free, and no amount of money should increase one's ability to access it. Likewise, I find my open-source position anti-thetic to paywalls, data brokering, obtrusive advertising, and personalized advertising. My hope is, with individual contributions, I may eventually treat my open-source volunteering as a tenable source of income.

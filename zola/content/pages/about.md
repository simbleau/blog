My name is Spencer C. Imbleau and this is my blog, a venue that I choose to contribute free education. My interest is piqued by hard topics, which drives the content for this blog. However, at times, I also blog for selfish reasons, documenting new information that is interesting to me. Moreover, I am an advocate for open-source education and hope you find value in what I may offer.

There is no release schedule, since this blog is a labor of love as a hobbyist researcher. I currently work at NASA as a software engineer on the Artemis mission which takes up most of my time. If you are looking for easier, or intermediate content, please find my YouTube channel.

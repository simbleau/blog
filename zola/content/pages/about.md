# Who am I?
My name is Spencer C. Imbleau and this is my blog, a platform I use to contribute free information. I currently reside in Florida, USA, where I work as a software engineer supporting NASA.

# Why?
My interest is piqued by hard topics, driving the content for my posts. I mainly blog for selfish reasons, documenting new information that is interesting to me or which can be easily forgotten. Since I am an advocate for open-source education, I present my content freely and hope you find value in it.

# Scheduling
There is no release schedule, since this blog is a labor of love as a hobbyist researcher. I currently work at NASA as a software engineer on the Artemis mission which takes up most of my time.
